# Clean Architecture App
This is a .NET Core application that demonstrates a clean architecture approach, using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

The application is separated into layers, with the core domain at the center and additional layers for infrastructure, presentation, and application services. This separation of concerns allows for a more modular and maintainable codebase.

The application uses the repository pattern to abstract the data store and the Mediator pattern to decouple the application services from the presentation layer.

Overall, this application serves as a template for building scalable and testable .NET applications using clean architecture principles.
